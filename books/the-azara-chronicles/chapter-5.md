Once the dwarves realized their enemy had necromancers, their entire plan changed.

Necromancers were dark mages who used ancient magic, feared and powerful. Their art was the raising of the dead, creating monsters that could not truly die. The only way to destroy such creatures was to kill the source of the summoning.

Their greatest threat lay in their range. They could hide far from the front lines and command the dead from the shadows.

The King quickly chose his strongest warriors and said:
“Spread east and north. Search beneath trees and stone. When you find these bastards, kill them.”

While the rest of the army fought against the restoring shadows, brave warriors broke away, rushing toward places where necromancers might hide.

But being separated from the others made them easy targets.

The demi-god finally joined the fierce battle. He carried no weapon, for his brute strength was enough.

He dashed forward with insane speed toward one of the separated dwarves and swung his sharp claws at his neck. But the dwarf was not weak. He blocked the strike with his hammer, then swung back quickly, striking the demon’s leg.

Only then was the true strength revealed. The demi-god felt pain, but not enough to make him move or even cry out.

“Monster!” the brave dwarf shouted in shock.

The demon swung again toward his face, but a gunshot rang out.

The bullet pierced through the demon’s claw, the impact forcing his arm aside and giving the dwarf time to escape.

The archers shifted their aim and loosed arrows toward the monster.

He tried to block them with his wings, covering his front, but the steel-polished arrows pierced through with ease.

The demi-god finally learned the truth.

Dwarves may look weak because of their size, but when they stand together, their strength can rival that of demons.
