The demons spread their wings wide and flew toward the mountains of Stonehelm, home of the dwarves.

Iron was in their blood, and weapons were their friends. They feared what was coming, but that fear only fueled their excitement.

Then the King himself emerged, wearing his own armor of steel and carrying a long warhammer. Heavy, strong, and powerful, ready to smash anything in his path.

It was him — King Thoradin Anvilheart.

Rumors said he had saved over a hundred children and defeated thousands without a single scar.

He stepped in front of his people, looking toward the main gate, and with a brave, steady voice said:

“Children of Stonehelm…
Shadows gather beyond our gates.
We face the unknown.
But we were shaped by stone, not broken by fear.
Stand with me, and let the mountain remember our strength!”

Simple words from his mouth, yet they fueled the flame in dwarven hearts.

They lifted their weapons,
guns, hammers, swords, bows, axes…

And with a war cry, they opened the gates of the mountain capital and marched out, ready for battle.

With a heart of resolve and hearts of iron, they watched the enemy approach.

But the demons’ goal was simple.
Take the shard, and kill everyone in their path.

Thoradin walked forward slowly, the dwarves awaiting his first command:

He watched carefully as the demons landed, but then darkness spread around them, swallowing the snowy ground.

From the earth, shadowy creatures and twisted monsters emerged.

They were heartless and mindless, rushing immediately toward the dwarves.
But it did not make them flinch.

The king commanded the dwarven army to begin firing.
Shots thundered, and arrows flew, piercing everything before them.

The creatures shattered and disappeared, only to reform moments later.

One of the dwarves gripping his axe growled in a deep voice,
“Necromancers.”

The creatures charged again, fearless and careless.
The first war had begun.
