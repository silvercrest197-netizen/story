From the shadow of the God, which stretched across the land like a living darkness, a demon rose. Its form was unnatural, not born or made for this world. It did not speak loudly, because it did not need to.

Just a simple command…

"Learn more about this gross world."

With a bow, the demon spread its hellish wings and vanished into the skies of Azara.

Months passed.

Life slowly returned to normal, but something still lingered. Then the rumors started. Travelers spoke of strange sights. Some claimed they had seen a dark shape flying high above the clouds. Others described wings made of fire…

At first, these stories were dismissed as fear and imagination, but the reports reached the capitals.

Messengers arrived with letters. Livestock was found burned. Watchtowers stood empty. Villagers spoke of a demon who was testing their strength. Not a single guard was able to even make a cut.

The scholars took notice.

The generals started planning their defense.

And for the first time, the rulers of Azara understood: this God had come not from heaven, it was straight from hell.

When the time had come, the demon returned to his lord holding the head of a Wood Elf. He threw it on the ground

“Ul’Thar Na Vorn. Zhar’Krax Nih Vern!” the demon spoke in the ancient, unknown language.

The meaning was clear to his lord: they are weak. Their lives mean nothing.

He smiled, predatory, saying only three words:

"Let's bring the army.”
