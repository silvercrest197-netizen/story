# *The Northern Mountains were visible from far away.*

 *High enough to touch the sky, old and massive, standing still since the beginning of time. Snow rested on their peaks, while strong winds screamed between the stone walls. Clouds crashed into the mountains and broke apart, feeding the cold land below. These mountains were not kind, but they were strong. And strength was what lived here.*

*The temperature was strange. Freezing cold most of the time, yet sometimes warm air came from deep inside the mountains. Rain was rare, but the wind never stopped. Our farms were poor, and forests were almost empty. Life here was hard. But we were not just anyone. We were dwarves. A strong race shaped by stone itself. We endure the cold. We endure pain.*

*Dwarves were a race led by hard work. Every dwarf belonged to a clan, and every clan had a leader who gave tasks to their people. Their goal was simple. Live for yourself, and live for the nation. They lived in the Northern Mountains because they knew something others did not. These mountains were not empty. They were full.*

*The clans divided their people into tasks, and soon the miners began digging deep into the caves. What they found was more than beauty. The stone was rich. Iron, coal, and bronze were close to the surface, easy to reach. This opened many paths. Blacksmiths grew in number, and stronger tools were forged. Better pickaxes, stronger hammers, sharper blades.*

*When gold was found, the dwarves did not fall into greed. They did not hide it, and they did not fight over it. Instead, the clans gathered on the highest mountain, Derbos. There, they spoke for many days. Long talks, heavy choices. In the end, they chose one dwarf to lead them all. A king.*

*The gold was collected, and the first crown was forged. Strong and simple, made of gold and crowned with a rare ruby. Thus, the first king was born.*

*But the king did not like distance. He did not like that some dwarves had to walk for days just to meet him. One day, he placed his hand on the stone of Derbos. It was solid, unbreakable. An idea was born. He called the clans and spoke of an underground capital. One city. One home. One heart for all dwarves.*

## *There was a vote. No one argued. This was the beginning of Stonehelm.*

*With skill and patience, the stone was carved into perfect shape. The gate was formed, massive and strong. Forgers decorated it with iron, both for beauty and defense. Miners dug deep corridors, halls, and homes. It took many years, many hands, and many lives of effort. But it was worth it.*

*The forges of Stonehelm warmed the stone itself, creating a perfect temperature inside. Warmer than the outside world. Stone became walls of defense, and iron became shields against all enemies. Stonehelm was alive. Trading, selling, forging, working. The sound of metal and stone filled every hall.*

*The king sat on a simple throne. Simple, because he chose his people over luxury. He watched the dwarves laugh, work, and live together. This was his Golden Age.*

*But a heavy feeling grew inside him. Not fear of starting war, but fear of facing one. He ordered the creation of weapons. Swords, axes, and hammers. Tools of war. Then came armor. Strong iron plates, built to endure.*

*Yet the bows were weak. They could not pierce iron armor. The king grew old, and before leaving the throne, a new discovery was made. Gunpowder. Soon after, the first firearms were created, firing explosive shots.*

*Many dwarves were not ready to wield such weapons, but many more were eager. They wanted to protect the Northern Mountains.*

*Ironheart Valley was built outside the capital, across a cold river. It became the training ground. There, children became warriors. Seniors hardened them with pain, blood, and discipline. They learned not to fear wounds, and not to cry from suffering.*

*This was the dwarves’ way.*

*Their spark was their love for one another. Their strength, their bond, their unity. They lived for their families, their friends, and their people.*

*They lived for Stonehelm.*
