The demi-god straightened himself and spoke in the language of the dwarves.

“You have time to surrender and give me the fragment…”

He looked directly into the King’s eyes.

“Or you will watch your people die, one after another.”

Blood from the wounds across his entire body began to move. It flowed slowly toward his open palm, drawn together as if pulled by an unseen force. The blood twisted and shaped itself, hardening into a spear made entirely of blood.

The King lifted a necklace from his chest. It was plain, but at its center hung a small box. He opened it and revealed the shard.

“If you want it,” Thoradin said calmly, “then come and take it.”

He signaled the shooters to retreat.

They trusted their King’s strength and fell back to support the front line.

Thoradin removed his crown and tossed it aside. He raised his warhammer, thick and heavy, forged for war.

It was a duel.
The demi-god against the King of the dwarves.

“I am Thoradin Anvilheart,” he said.

The demon answered, accepting the challenge.
“Razork.”

Without wasting another moment, Thoradin charged, swinging his hammer. The blow shattered the blood spear in half. He followed with a second strike, smashing Razork’s arm.

The demon leapt back, blood flowing from the broken spear into his body, reforming his limb.

Thoradin sighed.
“Blood magic. Cheap tricks.”

He stepped forward and swung for the demon’s legs, but this time the strike missed. Razork dodged and used his wings to accelerate, grabbing Thoradin by the chestplate and lifting him into the air. The force tore the hammer from the King’s grip.

Razork knew the truth. Dwarven bones were strong, but a fall from such height would crush them.

But it was already too late.

Thoradin chuckled and pulled a small hidden gun from beneath his armor.

“Surprise.”

He fired directly into the demon’s face. The impact sent Razork crashing downward, dropping Thoradin with him.

The King trusted the mountains of Stonehelm and their deep snow.

The impact was heavy, but not fatal. Only a single bone broke.

Thoradin rose and walked slowly toward Razork, who lay on the ground, his flesh already regenerating.

Around them, the battle was turning. Shadow creatures were thinning. Some necromancers had already fallen.

Near Thoradin lay the body of a fallen dwarf. He knelt and kissed the warrior’s forehead, a symbol of honor. He took the dwarf’s axe and turned back toward the demon.

“Razork,” he growled.

“You are the first who gave me a decent fight.”

Thoradin knew the regeneration could not be stopped. So he chose something the demon could not restore.

He placed his boot against Razork’s back, seized one of his wings, and swung the axe. The blade cut clean through.

For the first time, the demon screamed. Not from pain, but from the loss of something precious.

Thoradin lifted the severed wing high and roared to his army:

“KILL EVERYTHING THAT DOES NOT BELONG IN OUR HOME!”

The dwarves answered with fury, charging forward, smashing, cutting, and destroying all that stood before them.

Then Thoradin heard a branch snap behind him.

He turned just in time to see a necromancer seize the wounded demi-god. Shadows swallowed them both, and they vanished.

Thoradin cursed under his breath.

When he looked back to the battlefield, it was nearly over.

The dwarves had won this time, and they had taken a prize from the demi-god.

He looked over his people, then touched his neck and felt a small cut.

The medallion was gone.

The shard had been stolen, and like fools, the enemy had escaped with it.

The first war was over.
