But who were the Old Gods?
And why did they stand against the Titans and all creation?

Before time learned to flow, before stars burned or worlds took form, there was only the Empty Galaxy. Within that emptiness, something awakened.

The Void.

It was not alive as mortals understand life, nor did it think as Titans did. It was awareness without shape, hunger without end. From its depths, it shaped beings in its own image, reflections of its endless desire.

Thus, the Gods of the Void were born.

They took humanoid forms, much like the Titans, and possessed strength beyond measure. Yet where the Titans sought order, balance, and structure, the Void Gods sought expression through destruction. To them, creation was not sacred. It was a canvas meant to be broken.

While the Titans sculpted planets, raised mountains, and breathed life into worlds, the Void chose a darker path.

From darkness and nightmares, it shaped shadows.
From shadows and fear, it shaped monsters.
From monsters and pure Void, it shaped beings greater still.

The Void Lords.

These entities existed to watch and enjoy. They found pleasure in ruin, delight in madness, and purpose in watching the art of the Titans fall apart. Worlds were toys, and life was temporary entertainment.

At first, the destruction was small.

A corrupted land.
A broken civilization.
A single planet lost.

But as decades passed, the Void grew bolder. Dark magic spread unchecked. Wars ignited across the galaxy. Entire worlds were erased, their cores shattered, their histories lost forever.

The Titans could no longer ignore it.

They descended to confront the Void’s creations, believing a warning would be enough. They sought to restore balance without annihilation.

Then something answered.

From the deepest layers of the Void emerged a being unlike the others. It bore no known name, no origin that could be traced. It spoke no language and wore no form of authority.

The Void Gods called it only by a title.

Death.

Death was humanoid in shape, yet empty within. Where it walked, stars dimmed. Where it stood, existence weakened. Its presence drained divine strength itself.

Five Titans were required to face it.

Their battle shook the galaxy. Planets cracked beneath the force of their clash. Time bent, and space tore as divine power collided with pure annihilation. The war raged for years, draining both sides beyond limit.

At last, through sacrifice and unity, the Titans struck Death down.

Its form shattered.
Its essence was torn apart.
Its existence was unbound.

But Death was not destroyed.

Its essence scattered across the galaxy, carried by Void currents and cosmic winds. Fragments fell upon dead worlds, forgotten planets, and ash-covered lands. Where that essence touched the soil, something unnatural occurred.

Life bloomed.

From dead ground rose flowers of deep violet hue, glowing softly in the dark. They fed not on sunlight or water, but on magic and life itself. Wherever they grew, the land around them withered.

These were the Nyx flowers.

They carried the essence of Death itself. They drained power, weakened souls, and consumed magic slowly and relentlessly. Silent. Patient. Unavoidable.

The Titans did not notice them.

They believed the war was over. The Old Gods were chained. The Void was contained.

They were wrong.

For Death had not vanished.
It had taken root.
And its bloom would one day become Nyxara.

Somewhere in the galaxy, the flowers waited.
And when they were gathered, refined, and sealed,
Death would walk again, not as a being,
but as a relic.
